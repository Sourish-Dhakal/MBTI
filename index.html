<h1 id="hdgName"><abbr title="Myeers Briggs Typing Indicator">MBTI</abbr></h1>
<hr class="lineSeperate">
<h2>MBTI types people into one of 16 groups using answers you give to a quiz. But I can't give a test here, so you can just find which one you feel represents you the most. Be honest as well. First I will talk about the four different letters in a MBTI type, then I'll create a spot for all the different types and descriptions for all of them. Then I'll talk about the Cognitive Functions.</h2>
<hr class="lineSeperate">
<h1>Which letter from each box resonates with you?</h1>
<div class="divFlex">
<div class="divLetter"><h2><font class="fntLetter">I</font>ntroversion / <font class="fntLetter">E</font>xtroversion</h2><hr class="lineLetter"><p class="prgLetter"><font class="fnt2letter">Mind Element | How We Like To Be</font><br><br> If you're extroverted, you typically like places where you can be with others and gain energy when you're around others. When you're introverted, you like places where you're alone and you lose energy when you're around others and gain energy when you're alone. Extroverts are seen as very spontaneous, and they are, in the typical way you use it. In Myers Briggs, Extroverts are just people who gain energy around others.</p></div>
<div class="divLetter"><h2>I<font class="fntLetter">N</font>tuitive / <font class="fntLetter">S</font>ensing</h2><hr class="lineLetter"><p class="prgLetter"><font class="fnt2letter">Energy Element | How We See The World</font><br><br>Sensing types like to focus on the details, for example, a Sensor would say "Snow is cold." While Intuitives are the opposite, "There's Snow.". Sensing types get information from their senses while Intuitives like to think and compare that to what they remember. Intuitives are usually better debaters because of their skill with getting information quick. Sensors are also practical. They focus on what's happening or has happened. Intuitives are imaginative and curious. They think about the future alot. </p></div>
<div class="divLetter"><h2><font class="fntLetter">T</font>hinking / <font class="fntLetter">F</font>eeling</h2><hr class="lineLetter"><p class="prgLetter"><font class="fnt2letter">Nature Element | How We Make Decisions</font><br><br>Thinkers are more logical and efficent. As a <abbr title="Someone who's first or second cognitive function is Te or Ti">thinker dom</abbr>, I can say that logic and effiency is something important to thinking doms. Thinkers hide their feelings and ignore cooperation for logic and rationality. They are more likely to make decisions based on thinking. Feelers are more emotional and are empathic. They are people to go if you need help with your emotions. They will understand your emotions unlike Thinkers who will try to solve your problem like instantly. Feelers want cooperation. They also tend to be less competitive.</p></div>
<div class="divLetter"><h2><font class="fntLetter">J</font>udging / <font class="fntLetter">P</font>ercieving</h2><hr class="lineLetter"><p class="prgLetter"><font class="fnt2letter">Tactic Element | How We Like Things</font><br><br>Judgers will plan things. They are devisive and organized. They usually like structure and hate spontaneity. Percievers are the oppositive, they're more relaxed and flexible. They are amazing at spontaneity and think that structure ruins their freedom. Judgers will take time with decisions and plan their day before going along with it. Percievers will just go with the flow and react to whatever comes their way.</p></div>
</div>
<hr class="lineSeperate">
<h2>Pick one of those letters from each of those groups. It isn't an accurate test, so it won't be accurate, but we can try. After you take all those letters, put them together. I got <abbr title="Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judger.">ISTJ</abbr>. What did you get? You can read more about your personalities below. (The order I introduced them, left to right, is the way your type will be structured. For example, if I said im a JSTI, I wouldn't find it, but if I put it in the order, mind, energy, nature and tactic, then I would realize it's actually ISTJ and find mine.). First you'll find all the different roles/groups that each of the personality types are in. Then I'll introduce the personality types.</h2>
<hr class="lineSeperate">
<h1 style="font-size:50px;">Different Groups</h1>
<div class="divRoles">
<div style="background-color:green;"><center><h1 class="hdgRoles" style="color:white;">Diplomats<br>_NF_ Types</h1><img src="Diplomat.png" class="imgRoles"/><p class="prgRoles">Diplomats are about harmony and peace with everyone. They also do what they feel is right. They are very social and energetic people. Their feeling makes them want to have peace and harmony and their intuitive makes them think of possible futures where that can happen. These personality types are the people you want counselling or a therapist. They listen to you and try to emphasize with you. Being empathic makes them very influential people. They're usually very fun-loving people. Especially ENFJ and ENFP.</p></center></div>
<div style="background-color:yellow;"><center><h1 class="hdgRoles" id="explorer">Explorers<br>_S_P Types</h1><img src="Explorer.png" class="imgRoles"/><p class="prgRoles" style="color:black;">The Explorers are a very innovative type. With their main function being Se, they gather in the world around them. They're spontaneity helps them take in the information and turn it into an idea. ISTP is known for being very innovative, and it's no suprise. Despite having just one letter different from Sentinels, they are actually very different. Showcasing just how important it is to be exact to your personalitiy type if you want to learn about yourself. Explorers like to explore things, like in their name. ESTP and ISTP are really good with work. This is because their ST helps them focus on the task at hand and the P helps them innovate.</p></center></div>
<div style="background-color:blue;"><center><h1 class="hdgRoles" style="color:white;">Sentinels<br>_S_J Types</h1><img src="Sentinel.png" class="imgRoles"/><p class="prgRoles">Sentinels are the most loyal out of all the personalities. Their function stack has Si in the first or second slot making them structure loving personalities. J is all about organization and S is all about getting information. With these two combined, they end up getting information to organization. Si, their domniant or auxiliry function, is all about organization. But ISTJ and ESTJ are the most likely types to end up getting things organized because of their Te. ISTJ are going to organize the things around them, and ESTJ are going to organize the people.</p></center></div>
<div style="background-color:purple;"><center><h1 class="hdgRoles" style="color:white;">Analysts<br>_NT_ Types</h1><img src="Analyst.png" class="imgRoles"/><p class="prgRoles">Analysts are types who are rational. They are amazing at debating because of their N, especially INTP and ENTP. They are independent and imaginative. They don't care about what looks appealing and would worry about how they work. They're amazing strategic thinkers and very strong with the amount of information they carry. But this makes Analysts really hard for social needs.</p></center></div>

<hr class="lineSeperate">
<h1 style="font-size:50px;">Personality Types</h1>
<div class="divPersonalityRoleBackgound" style="background-color:cyan;">
<h1 class="hdgPersonality">Sentinels</h1>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="ISTJ.png" style="margin-left:-30px;"/><h1>Logistician</h1><h2>ISTJ</h2><p>My personality type. Logistician types are very logical and organized. If you need something to be organized, or some routine to be made, ask them. They strive on routine and predicability. Si is their dominant function, which means they love being organized. Te is their second function which basically says, we do work when we need to. They look order, and would create structure and order. But they don't have the ability to voice their own opinions. They overthink things and wonder if there's any holes in their logic. Logisticians love logic, and strive off of things such as math and coding. Anything could happen to the world, the world could explode. Your friends could do the weirdest things, and you can't understand why. But atleast you'll know forever that 1+1 is 2 and 2 x 5 is 10.</p></div>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="ESTJ.png" style="margin-left:-50px;"/><h1>Executives</h1><h2>ESTJ</h2><p>ISTJ if only if they speaked. The stereotype for this personality type is that they're incredibilty bossy. It's safe to say that when there's chaos, they will try to make it settle down. Being a structure loving personality just like ISTJ, they will do whatever they can for structure but unlike the ISTJ, they will actually speak their mind. ESTJ's are generally very good teachers and handling little kids. Their main function is Te which is all about let's do work. Their second function is Si which says organization. ESTJ's are a lot like ENTJ's but ENTJ's will focus more on the goal. ESTJ's will focus more on organizing everything. While you may call an ISTJ to help make a routine for you, you should call ESTJ to help enforce order and structure. If you have an idea of what you're doing, but can't get other people to listen, call an ESTJ. They will make sure that it's all organized.</p></div>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="ISFJ.png" style="margin-left:-50px;" /><h1>Defender</h1><h2>ISFJ</h2><p>ISTJ's may seem cold-hearted, ISFJ's are completely different. They are amazing at nursing and being a doctor. ISTJ's focus more on the work, ISFJ's worry about how everyone is feeling. They will sacrifice themselves to help you. They're very caring people, but are a lot like ISTJ, where they worry about organization. They love good structure and order, which is why if something bad happens. Such as someone breaks a vase for example. They might lie and say they broke it. Just so that no one else gets in trouble. This is very self sacrificing behaviour, and is one of their weaknesses.</p></div>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="ESFJ.png" style="width:100%;margin-left:-30px;"/><h1>Consul</h1><h2>ESFJ</h2><p>Very caring and social people. ESFJ is just ISFJ but extroverted. They're considered very people pleasing and self sacrificing. They still love structure and order, just like the rest of the sentinels. And would sacrifice themselves for it, but it's incredible to the amount that they would sacrifice themselves for. Their S J makes them want organization and peace and their E F makes them do things based on their feeling. While ISTJ's and ESTJ's would try to find the actually answer, because they believe honesty is the best vitue, ISFJ and ESFJ would say that white lies are good.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="divPersonalityRoleBackgound" style="background-color:yellow;">
<h1 class="hdgPersonality">Explorers</h1>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="ISTP.png" style="margin-left:-30px;" /><h1>Virtuso</h1><h2>ISTP</h2><p>Virtuso's are very innovative people. I would consider them the most innovative of all the personality types. Their function stack includes Se which says they want to experience the world. But becuase they're introverted, they don't want to explore the actual world. They want to explore other things. (It'll make sense later) Their thinking makes them do work. So their introverted and thinking makes them very introspective and hard working. They're very silent. Their I and T makes them want to explore other things, experiments. Se isn't about having experiences, it's about taking in everything they can. Virtuso's want to take in the world through a logical way and want to be their own thing. They want to create their own thing. They are probably the best personality type to call if you need to fix anything. They are very innovative and can think fast on their feet.</p></div>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="ESTP.png"  style="margin-left:-50px;"/><h1>Entrepeneurs</h1><h2>ESTP</h2><p>Nicknamed "Chad" in the MBTI community. They are the chads of MBTI. They are quick thinking like ENTP. They're good at persuading people, which is why they're nicknamed the Entrepreneur. ENTP's want to debate for the sake of debate. But ESTP's always have a reason to debate. And they're not afraid of it, unlike ISTP. ISTP's need their alone time, while ESTP's need to persuade people. Their Se dominince is what causes them to do thinks, they want to be rich and have the skill set to do it. </p></div>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="ISFP.png" style="margin-left:-50px;"/><h1>Adventurers</h1><h2>ISFP</h2><p>They are very artistic, not just in visual arts. But in everything, they are skilled at it. They can do anything on the spot and are always ready to explore. They're amazing friends to have, I can say from experience. They're incredibily supportive and only want what's best for you. They can create things anytime they need to. They're really just a nice personality to be around.</p></div>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="ESFP.png"  style="margin-left:-30px;"/><h1>Entertainer</h1><h2>ESFP</h2><p>ESFP is a lot like ENFP. ESTP, ENTP ; ESFP, ENFP are two sets of personality duos that are pretty similar. But the only difference is the second letter. Which causes the reason they do things to be different. While ENFP's might want to have fun for the sake of having fun. ESFP want to have fun because they want to experience everything. Explorers want to experience everything in life. ESFP's are a fun personality to be around, you can't get bored with them.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="divPersonalityRoleBackgound" style="background-color:lime;">
<h1 class="hdgPersonality">Diplomats</h1>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="INFJ.png" style="margin-left:-30px;"/><h1>Advocate</h1><h2>INFJ</h2><p>These are people you can talk to. They will soak in everything you say to them. They will stress for you. They will emphasize with you. They think that they have some purpose to their lives. But not the same thing as other personalities, not solving an issue. But mentally helping people. These are the people who will make sure you're doing mentally okay and will be your personal therapist just because they want to help people. </p></div>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="ENFJ.png"  style="margin-left:-50px;"/><h1>Protagonist</h1><h2>ENFJ</h2><p>They feel like they've been called to a greater purpose. Even if it may just be helping people. ENFJ and INFJ will help you just because. They want social harmony. ENFJ's are the ones to create social harmony. E_TJ usually lead to create structure or complete a goal. But ENFJ will do whatever they feel is right, they won't focus on the goal but focus on the mental health of everyone. If stranded on a island, and appointed leader. They wouldn't do what ENTJ and ESTJ would do, they wouldn't make everyone have some tasks to do and force them to do it until they complete a goal/they can surivve on the island comfortably. They would do the same thing, but they would be more leniant. They want to create a nice atmosphere with everyone.</p></div>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="INFP.png" style="margin-left:-50px;" /><h1>Mediator</h1><h2>INFP</h2><p>These are probably the most emotional of all the personalities. They could cry on the spot, and just want peace. INFP's are seen as a very feminine type. This doesn't mean they're incapable. They just have trouble adjusting to stress. They want and need peace. They aren't able to create peace and order but really do enjoy it. They also just want to have a fun time.</p></div>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="ENFP.png"  style="margin-left:-30px;"/><h1>Campaigner</h1><h2>ENFP</h2><p>These are fun types to be around, who seemingly have no care in the world. They also would be very emotinoal and open and openly stress about things. Something that truly amazes me. Their my complete opposite type and I truly am fascinated by ENFP. They just do whatever they feel like, they feel like structure and order removes their freedom. They're very supportive just like all of the diplomats. They are amazing friends, and they're just incredibly fun to be around. How can you be bored with an ENFP next to you. They are very expressive personality types.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="divPersonalityRoleBackgound" style="background-color:pink;">
<h1 class="hdgPersonality">Analysts</h1>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="INTJ.png" style="margin-left:-30px;"/><h1>Architect</h1><h2>INTJ</h2><p>These types of people are very strategic. They think of  life as a big game of chess. Play the game properly, you'll win. They have a plan for everything, but they don't have the ability to voice it. If you need someone to strategize something, this is the type to call. Amateur typers (Including me!) will call you an INTJ if you have an IQ of more than 5. They're very imaginative and will think things through. </p></div>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="ENTJ.png"  style="margin-left:-10px;"/><h1>Commander</h1><h2>ENTJ</h2><p>ENTJ is like a mix of ESTJ and INTJ. ENTJ is just INTJ who decided to speak up and lead. ENTj is also just ESTJ who's more focused on the goal than the ESTJ. ESTJ boss around for structure, ENTJ's boss around to solve an issue/solve a problem. ESTJ's do it for structure, ENTJ's do it for a goal. When they're dedicated and passoniate about something, they will gather everybody to help achieve it. ENTJ's, just like the ESTJ's are percieved as having no emotions. For good reason, these types generally disregard emotions to complete their job. To lead.</p></div>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="INTP.png" style="margin-left:-50px;" /><h1>Logician</h1><h2>INTP</h2><p>These types have an unquenable thirst for knowlegde. They want to know everything. They also know everybody has something they can teach you, which is why they will listen. They're always learning and there is nothing that can stop them. If you're an INTP, don't worry it's not just studies and math and language. It's anything, any topic you love. For example, I love MBTI so I might scour the internet for every tiny drop of knowlegde, but I don't because I'm an ISTJ and do other work instead. When I do find time, I do like to learn about MBTI. If you do this obsessively then you probably are an INTP. This insane amount of knowlegde and their personality type also helps them debate. _NTP's have really good skill sets to debate. Their intuition makes them summon up knowlegde/use logic to prove a point. It also makes them imaginative. Their thinking makes them rational in the moment and their percieving makes them spontaneous enough to be able to debate. INTP's aren't as argumentative as ENTP's but if you get an INTP to argue about an area they know, you'll be there forever.</p></div>
<div class="divPersonality"><img src="ENTP.png" style="margin-left:-30px;" /><h1>Debater</h1><h2>ENTP</h2><p>These types are considered the worst in all of MBTI. For good reason, they like to start arguments with everyone. ESTP's will argue to persuade you into something important. Such as changing your life for the better. But ENTP's will argue with you for fun. FOR FUN. They, just like INTP, have lots of knowlegde and logic. They can debate on the spot for everything. The reason why they are hated is because of how argumentative they are. INTP's are considered better than ENTP's because they atleast don't argue with everyone.</p></div>
</div>
<hr class="lineSeperate">
<h1 style="font-size:50px;">Cognitive Functions</h1>
<h2>We're going to move on to the cognitive functions of the different personality types. The cognitive functions is what makes a personality type the personality type. An ISTJ and ISFJ should be pretty similar personality types. And they are similar, but they're different in a lot of ways. T and F shouldn't change much other than the way they handle people but they are still different in many ways. The reason? Cognitive Functions. If you know your MBTI, you can find out your cognitive functions and find out what makes you do what you do!<br><br>
There are a few things about cognitive functions.
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>Each cognitive function starts will sensing, intuition, thinking or feeling and then ends with introversion or extraversion.</li>
<li>An extroverted function is a function that outwardly represents their function. An introverted function is a function that focuses more on the inside.</li>
<li>Each personality type has 4 cognitive functions.</li>
<li>The dominant function is the function that the personality type uses the most. It's also the first function.</li>
<li>The auxiliary function is the second function and aids the dominant function in expressing their function.</li>
<li>The third function is a very weak function. It usually comes up later in life.</li>
<li>The fourth function is the most under-developed.</li>
<li>An extroverted personality type will have an extraverted dominant function.</li>
<li>An introverted personality type will have an introverted dominant function.</li>
<li>___J's have an extraverted sensing or intuitive function. ___P's have an extraverted thinking or feeling function.</li>
<li>Each person has a sensing, intuitive, thinking and a feeling function.</li>
</ul>
</h1>
<hr class="lineSeperate">
<div class="divCognitiveFunctions">
<div class="divFunction"><h1>Se</h1><p>The Se function is about getting information and taking in the world. They use the 5 senses to get all the information they can get. They are very obsevant because of this. They don't want to miss anything and live in the present. They don't like to worry about the future.<br><br>Se is the dominant function in <b>ESTP</b> and <b>ESFP</b>.<br>Se is the auxiliary function in <b>ISTP</b> and <b>ISFP</b>. All the explorers have Se as a prominent function.</p></div>
<div class="divFunction"><h1>Si</h1><p>The Si function is all about getting the information they have and organizing it. They love organization and routines. They also relate past things to the present. To make sure that what they're doing is proper. They use the senses to build judgement on the world. THey also use their senses to find out the way the world works and is.<br><br>Si is the dominant function in <b>ISTJ</b> and in <b>ISFJ</b>.<br>Si is the auxiliry function in <b>ESTJ</b> and <b>ESFJ</b>. All the sentinels have Si as a prominent function.</p></div>
<div class="divFunction"><h1>Ne</h1><p>The Ne function is about thinking about future possibilities. These types are thinking a lot about the future. They also see patterns absolutely everywhere. They're a very creative and imaginative personality type. They are also very spontaneous and are really good with socializing. They are very inclusive and are sure to tag a friend along on their weird journeys.<br><br>Ne is the primary function in <b>ENTP</b> and <b>ENFP</b>.<br>Ne is the auxiliary function in <b>INTP</b> and <b>INFP</b>.</p></div>
<div class="divFunction"><h1>Ni</h1><p>Ni is described as "knowing without knowing" and "thinking without thinking". These types just know things because of they way they predict everything. When you ask an Ni how they got to a conclusion, they wouldn't be able to give an answer. They are not very logical people and just do things with the flow. Their subconcious mind is what drives them and controls them through everything they do.<br><br>Ni is the primary function in <b>INTJ</b> and <b>INFJ</b>.<br>Ni is the auxiliary function in <b>ENTJ</b> and <b>ENFJ</b>.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="divCognitiveFunctions">
<div class="divFunction"><h1>Te</h1><p>Te is considered the least emotional of all the cognitive functions. This function is all about work and can abandon emotions in order to make reasonable arguments and decisions. They are considered very persuasive and are able to make rock solid arguments that are very hard to break. Logic and Reason is how they do things.<br><br>Te is the primary function for <b>ENTJ</b> and <b>ESTJ</b>.<br>Te is the auxilry function in <b>INTJ's </b>and <b>ISTJ's</b>.</p></div>
<div class="divFunction"><h1>Ti</h1><p>Ti is a function that is also purely on logic. All their drive is from inside and can hardly be influenced at all. They are deeply analytical and what they believe is based on their past and all their beliefs. Everything that happens to them cannot slide without them knowing exactly why it happened. They are the most likely to be introspective and try to improve on their mistakes.<br><br>Ti is the dominant function for <b>INTP</b> and <b>ISTP</b>.<br>Ti is the auxiliary for <b>ENTP</b> and <b>ESTP.</b></p></div>
<div class="divFunction"><h1>Fe</h1><p>Fe is a very self-driven function. They are going to have their values built on their own beliefs but can easily be changed. They will help everyone and will make sure everyone is happy. They will find out everything that you need and try to help fix that. Their values are very changeable by societal and cultural customs. These people are sensitive and empathetic.<br><br>Fe is the dominant function for <b>ENFJ</b> and <b>ESFJ</b><br>Fe is the auxiliary functoin for <b>INFJ</b> and <b>ISFJ</b>.</p></div>
<div class="divFunction"><h1>Fi</h1><p>Fi is the personality type to take in all the damage. They are very empathetic and will try to take in all the damage to make sure their loved ones are happy. They values are driven built from their own beliefs and are very hard to change.  They act as if someone else's pain is their own and will try to relieve the other person's pain even if it means sacrficing themselves.  They'll do whatever they need to do despite if it defies the societal and cultural customs. <br><br>Fi is the dominant function for <b>INFP</b> and <b>ISFP.</b><br>Fi is the auxiliary function for <b>ENFP</b> and <b>ESFP</b>.</p></div>
</div>
<hr class="lineSeperate">
<h2>Now that you know each of the cognitive functions and what they each talk about, we can talk about what functions drive each personality type. Let's talk about how it's sorted first. The first function is the dominant function and is the primary function that the person uses to do his tasks. The second function is the auxiliary function, it's the function that helps the dominant function. The third function is an under-developed function and usually comes up later in life. The fourth funtion is the one we use the least, but it does usually come up under a lot of stress.
<ul style="text-align:left;margin-left:50px;">
<li>ISTJ: Si -> Te -> Fi -> Ne</li>
<li>ESTJ: Te -> Si -> Ne -> Fi</li>
<li>ISFJ: Si -> Fe -> Ti -> Ne</li>
